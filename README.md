# 🚀 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge

This repository documents my progress during a personal **30-day challenge** learning and practicing JavaScript using as a reference the repository from Asabeneh. 30 Days of JavaScript. To be honest it was a great experience to improve my JavaScript skills, it went from the basics to more difficult exercises day by day.
The goal was to strengthen my programming logic and build mini projects that demonstrate my growth day by day.
